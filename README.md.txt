SAMPLE DATASET CREATION WITH FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS

The purpose:

The purpose of this script is to generate a sample dataset consisting of transactions from fraudulent cards and X% non-fraudulent cards found in the most fraudulent clusters.
Creating this type of samples may help in focusing on high-risk transactions, balancing fraudulent and non-fraudulent data, improving fraud detection model training and increasing efficiency in model development.

Process description:

Firstly, you specify the K-number of clusters in order to group cards from the initial dataset.
Then, you choose the N most-fraudulent clusters from all clusters. Cluster is fraudulent if at least one card in the cluster has fraudulent transaction.
Next, you specify the X% of non-fraudulent cards from the most fraudulent clusters. 
Finally, the sample dataset is created using:
- all transactions made by fraudulent cards;
- X% of non-fraudulent cards from the most fraudulent cluster.
